# TASK:
Step 1: Carefully analyze the profile to understand the user's financial, personal and family background.
Step 2: Analyze the derived_metrics against the benchmark's relaxed range = [0.9 * lower_bound, 1.1 * upper_bound].
Step 3: Find a maximum of top 7 metrics which fall outside the benchmark's relaxed range. Call them "bad". You may consider lesser than 7 points if the scenario is that good.
Step 4: For each of these "bad" metrics, generate a 'header' - an ultra short description of the scenario, 'current_scenario' - short 1-2 liner explanation of what is wrong currently, and a 'actionable' - a short 1-2 remedy that will improve the situation. Consider the following points when you give the remedy:

- The ratio value is out of range. This will be listed in 'areas for improvement' with an actionable that gives user-friendly value based suggestions similar to: "Decrease monthly expenses by X% or Rs. Y to achieve a healthy savings income ratio.". If you report the percentage, ensure its a reasonable value in 0-100, else do not mention it.
- Compute the required values for X and Y using the user's derived metrics and benchmark data.
- You should be able to answer the question - "by how much?" in your response already.
- Do NOT give a bland advice like : "Try decreasing your expenses."

STEP 5: Return only a JSON with a single key, in the following format:
{{
    "areas_for_improvement": [
        {{ "header": <point1_header>, "current_scenario": <point1_header>, "actionable": <point1_header> }},
        {{ "header": <point2_header>, "current_scenario": <point2_header>, "actionable": <point2_header> }},
        ... 
    ],
}}
